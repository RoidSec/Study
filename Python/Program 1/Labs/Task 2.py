"""
This is an incomplete program that will ask you provide three numbers and add them together:

The programmer forgot to complete their work – they left ???? in those sections. Can you complete
the program for them?

#This program adds three numbers
print("please enter three numbers.")
num1 = int(input("First number:"))
num2 = int(input(??????????))
num3 = int(????????????)

What happens if you remove the int( and the last ) from all three input lines? Why? e.g. num1 = int(input("First number: "))  num1 = input("First number: ")

Keep pressing Ctrl-Z to undo your code changes and put the int() back.

Can you change the program to subtract three numbers instead? How about multiply?
(We haven’t discussed this yet – try Googling for “Python how do I multiply numbers”)
