"""
Complete this program to output the day that Canada Day falls on (July 1st).
Next, change your program to output Australia Day instead of Canada Day; change the name of the variable to make the name more accurate.
Add a variable on line 4 that stores the number: 116. Add a print statement on line 5 to say 
The oldest person alive is Emma Morano, and she is 116
(don’t type the number in again – use your variable)
Change line 5: Use the special \Tab and \Return characters to put spaces around Emma’s
name and print her age on a line all by itself.
Change line 5 again – can you put her age in the middle of the screen?
